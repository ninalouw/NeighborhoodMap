# NeighborhoodMap
Single-page app built with Knockout.js using Google Maps API for Udacity Frontend Nanodegree.

## Project Overview
You will develop a single page application featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit. You will then add functionality to this map including highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content.

1. Knockout must be used to handle the list, filter, and any other information on the page that is subject to changing state.
2. Asynchrony and Error Handling. Note that all data APIs used in the project should load asynchronously and errors should be handled gracefully.
3. Write code required to add a full-screen map to your page using the Google Maps API.
4. Write code required to display map markers identifying at least 5 locations that you are interested in within this neighborhood. Your app should display those locations by default when the page is loaded.
5. Implement a list view of the set of locations defined in step 4.
6. Provide a filter option that uses an input field to filter both the list view and the map markers displayed by default on load. The list view and the markers should update accordingly in real time.
7. Add functionality using third-party APIs to provide information when a map marker or list view entry is clicked (ex: Yelp reviews, Wikipedia, Flickr images, etc).
8. Add functionality to animate a map marker when either the list item associated with it or the map marker itself is selected.
9. Add functionality to open an infoWindow with the information described in step 8 when either a location is selected from the list view or its map marker is selected directly.
10. The app's interface should be intuitive to use.
